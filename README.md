# Render deployment

This will be a guide for deploying a multi service application to render.io

- Frontend - NextJs with SRR
- Backend - Spring boot
- DB - postgres

For ease of development we will run a docker-compose to connect our services. Ideally the transition from running locally to deployment on render is minimal
